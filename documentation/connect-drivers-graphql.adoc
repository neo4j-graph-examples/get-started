== Install the Neo4j GraphQL Library and dependencies

[source, bash, copy=true]
----
npm install @neo4j/graphql@alpha graphql neo4j-driver @apollo/server
----

. `@neo4j/graphql` is the official Neo4j GraphQL Library package.
  It takes your GraphQL type definitions and generates a schema backed by a Neo4j database.
. `graphql` generates a schema and execute queries and mutations.
. `neo4j-driver` is the official Neo4j Driver package for JavaScript, of which an instance must be passed into the Neo4j GraphQL Library.
. The https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/[`@apollo/server`] is the default GraphQL server package for Apollo Server.

== Connect to the database

The following JavaScript snippet connects to a Neo4j database.
Set your values for `<neo4j-database-uri>`, `<username>` and `<password>`:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
import neo4j from "neo4j-driver";
import { Neo4jGraphQL } from "@neo4j/graphql";

const driver = neo4j.driver(
    "<neo4j-database-uri>",
    neo4j.auth.basic("<username>", "<password>")
);

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({ typeDefs, driver });
----


== Set GraphQL type definitions

Add a constant to your JavaScript that holds GraphQL type definitions.
Here is a simple example with two node types, one with label "Actor" and the other "Movie":

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const typeDefs = `#graphql
    type Movie @node {
        title: String
        actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
    }

    type Actor @node {
        name: String
        movies: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)
    }
`;
----


== Create an instance of `ApolloServer`

Add the following to your JavaScript to create an Apollo Server instance:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
import { ApolloServer } from '@apollo/server';
import { startStandaloneServer } from '@apollo/server/standalone';

const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema: await neoSchema.getSchema(),
});

const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(server, {
    listen: { port: 4000 },
});

console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
----


== Start the server

Make sure that your JavaScript file looks like this:

[source, javascript]
----
import { ApolloServer } from '@apollo/server';
import { startStandaloneServer } from '@apollo/server/standalone';
import { Neo4jGraphQL } from "@neo4j/graphql";
import neo4j from "neo4j-driver";

const typeDefs = `#graphql
    type Movie @node {
        title: String
        actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
    }

    type Actor @node {
        name: String
        movies: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)
    }
`;

const driver = neo4j.driver(
    "neo4j://localhost:7687",
    neo4j.auth.basic("username", "password")
);

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({ typeDefs, driver });

const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema: await neoSchema.getSchema(),
});

const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(server, {
    context: async ({ req }) => ({ req }),
    listen: { port: 4000 },
});

console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
----

You are ready to start up your GraphQL server.
Execute your JavaScript with `node`:

[source, bash, indent=0]
----
node [yourJavaScriptFile].js
----

If successful, you should see the following output:

[source, bash, indent=0]
----
ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000/
----

That is where the Apollo server starts.

Use the Apollo server to execute mutations and populate your database.
