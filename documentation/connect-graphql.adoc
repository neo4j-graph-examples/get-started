----

link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graphql/current/getting-started/[More info on installing the Neo4j GraphQL Library]


== Connect to the database

Connect to the Neo4j server via `neo4j.driver()` and your server credentials.

[source, javascript]
----
import neo4j from "neo4j-driver";

const driver = neo4j.driver(
    "<neo4j-database-uri>",
    neo4j.auth.basic("<username>", "<password>")
);
----


== Set GraphQL type definitions

Provide the GraphQL type definitions mapping to the nodes and relationships in your Neo4j database through `Neo4jGraphQL`.

.Type definitions for node labels `Actor` and `Movie` and relationship `ACTED_IN`
[source, javascript]
----
import { Neo4jGraphQL } from "@neo4j/graphql";

const typeDefs = `#graphql
    type Movie @node {
        title: String
        actors: [Actor!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
    }

    type Actor @node {
        name: String
        movies: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT)
    }
`;

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({ typeDefs, driver });
----


== Create an instance of Apollo Server

Start an `ApolloServer` instance drawing its schema from the Neo4j type definitions.
Execute mutations and link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graphql/current/getting-started/#_create_nodes_in_the_database[create nodes in the database] through the Apollo server.

[source, javascript]
----
import { ApolloServer } from '@apollo/server';
import { startStandaloneServer } from '@apollo/server/standalone';

const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema: await neoSchema.getSchema(),
});

const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(server, {
    listen: { port: 4000 },
});

console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
