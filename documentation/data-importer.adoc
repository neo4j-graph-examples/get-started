== Introduction

Workspace's data importer offers a powerful and simple way to model and load data into Neo4j.
It's great if you're new to graphs or have rapid prototyping needs.
If you have more advanced needs, checkout the _What's next?_ section at the end of this guide.

This guide will teach you how to:

* Create a graph model
* Configure its properties and relationships
* Upload and map data files (we have prepared some for you)

[TIP]
====
If you haven't already, it's recommended to go through the _Getting started with Neo4j_ guide to learn the basics of Neo4j.
This guide is continuing with the same dataset, Northwind.
====


== Working with data files

=== Add the Northwind files

To get started, {northwind-subset-data-only-zip-file}[download and unzip this file of CSVs^] and then drop the files onto the highlight:import/import-file-panel[files panel].

[%collapsible]
.Are you having trouble?
====
You can also click the following button to add the CSV files automatically.

button::Add Northwind files[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint={northwind-subset-data-only-zip-file}]
====

=== File structure

Now that you've added the files, you should be able to see each file's header and the first row of data in the highlight:import/import-file-panel[Files panel].

[TIP]
====
Importer always requires files to have a *header row* as well as at least one *data row* in order to map and import data.
====

The `order-details.csv` file looks like this:

----
OrderID,ProductID,UnitPrice,Quantity,Discount
10248,11,14.00,12,0
10248,42,9.8,10,0
10248,72,34.8,5,0
----

This file tells you which orders contain specific products and their price.
If you inspect the content of the file, you'll notice that `OrderID` is repeated.
You'll learn later about how this can be used to create a `CONTAINS` relationship linking `Orders` and `Products`.

The `products.csv` and `orders.csv` files refer to the other parts of the Northwind data model.


== Nodes and properties

=== Create the Order node

You are going to create a simple model with two nodes and one relationship.
Add a node using the highlight:import/import-add-node[add node button], and give it the label `Order`.

image::simple-model.png[]

=== Map a file

The `Order` node you have just created isn't fully mapped yet; it needs to show a green check mark.
Select `orders.csv` from the highlight:import/import-node-file-dropdown[file dropdown] in the highlight:import/import-mapping-panel[mapping details panel].


=== Defining and mapping properties

Let's now add some properties to the `Order` node from our `orders.csv` file.

* Click the highlight:import/import-select-from-file-button[Map from file] button.
* Select the `orderId`, `orderDate` and `requiredDate` columns and click *Confirm*.
* Edit the `orderId` property in the mapping details panel by clicking the pencil icon.
* Change its data type from `integer` to `string`, and then rename it to `id` (it obviously relates to an order).
* Click the check mark to save your edit.

[NOTE]
====
When selected from file, properties are given the name of the column selected when created.
Workspace guesses each datatype based on a sample of the values it found.
Always double-check this when working with unfamiliar data.
For example, Northwind's date/time columns are identified as strings, but you can edit that if you want to.
====
// TODO: properties with same name... this needs rewording for clarity.


== Relationships and IDs

=== Setting a node ID

Nodes need an ID to define relationships with other nodes.
An ID also ensures an import doesn't create a node more than once if it's referenced multiple times in a data file.

If you go back to the _Definition_ tab, you can see that the `id` property is set as the ID for the node highlight:import/import-node-id[ID].
The import tool did this for you automatically based on the property name containing the `id` string.
In other cases, you may need to correct it or set it manually.

[TIP]
====
You can also specify properites and their data types in isolation from mapping by using the highlight:import/import-property-add-button[add property] button.
You can then map a column from your data file to the property in the file mapping tab.
====


=== Create the Product node

Now you just need to repeat the process you followed for `Order` and create a `Product` node from the `products.csv` file.
Here you need to map the `produtId` and `productName` columns, rename the `productId` property to be simply `id` and set it to be a `string`.
Ensure `id` is selected as the ID.

[%collapsible]
.Are you having trouble?
====
If you're unsure if you've followed the steps correctly so far, you can go ahead and load the correct mapping so everything is in order before continuing.

button::Load Northwind node mapping[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint={northwind-subset-node-only-mapping-zip-file}]
====


== Create relationships

[TIP]
====
As you've seen already, your data concerns `Orders` that `CONTAIN` specific `Products`.
Conventionally, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case[CamelCase^] is used for node labels and capitalized https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case[SNAKE_CASE^] for relationship types.
====

You have two nodes and now you need to create a relationship to connect them.

* Hover by the edge of the `Order` node circle and you'll see a `+` sign.
* Click and hold it and you'll see another circle.
* Drag the new circle on to the `Product` node and relase to create the relationship.
* With the relationship arrow selected, you can now specify how `Order` relates to `Product`.
* In the highlight:import/import-relationship-type[type] section of the highlight:import/import-mapping-panel[mapping details panel], enter the text `CONTAINS`.

[TIP]
====
Just like newly created nodes, the relationship will only show a green check mark once you have completed its mapping.
You can also name relationships by double-clicking the arrow in the graph model and typing it directly.
You can rapidly add nodes with a linking relationship by releasing the circle on an empty space the canvas instead of an existing node.
Selected nodes can be deleted by clicking the highlight:import/import-delete-node-or-rel[delete button] or with the backspace key.
====

== Map a file to a relationship

The next stage is critical in helping the importer understand how a file defines a relationship.
This is what will give you a connected graph.

* If you look in the highlight:import/import-file-panel[Files panel], you'll see `order-details.csv` has columns that correspond with the `id` of our `Order` and `Product` nodes.
* Ensuring you have the relationship selected, select the `order-details.csv` file from the highlight:import/import-relationship-file-dropdown[File dropdown].
// TODO: Add id selector for relationship dropdown to enable UI higlighting
* In the highlight:import/import-relationship-mapping-table[relationship mapping table] you will see the nodes and ID properties at each end of the `CONTAINS` relationship.

Setup the *From* and *To* for the `CONTAINS` relationship:

* The `From` end of the node is the `Order` node with the `id` property (remember that this property was mapped to the `orderId` column in the `orders.csv` file).
* Your `order-details.csv` file also contains an `orderId` column, so select this in the highlight:import/import-rel-from-dropdown[from dropdown].
This gives Data Importer the information it requires to link up the From end of the relationship.
* You need to select the correct file column for the `To` end of the relationship (the Product node).
As you might guess, this is the `productId` in the highlight:import/import-rel-to-dropdown[to dropdown]

Everything in the highlight:import/import-model-panel[Graph Model pane] should now have green check marks as you have successfully mapped the file.

=== More properties for richer queries

For relationships, you can add properties that may be useful for your queries.

In the `order-details.csv` file, you'll notice the columns `unitPrice`, `quantity` and `discount` could be useful to add as properties to the `CONTAINS` relationship.
These properties are well suited to being on the relationship since they couldn't easily be encapsulated on the nodes at either end of the relationship.
For example `quantity` does not belong on either the `Product` or `Order` nodes since products will be sold in different quantities on different orders.

Just as you did for nodes, use the highlight:import/import-select-from-file-button[Map from file] button to map those columns to new properties on the relationship.

[TIP]
====
You don't need to include the `orderID` or the `productID` here, as their only purpose is to create the `CONTAINS` relationship in our model and we've already used them to do that.
====

[%collapsible]
.Are you having trouble?
====
If you're unsure if you've followed the steps correctly so far, you can go ahead and load the correct mapping so everything is in order before continuing.

button::Load model and mapping[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint={northwind-subset-node-and-relationship-mapping-zip-file}]
====

== Dealing with different file structures

=== Relationship defined in the same file as one node

In this example, a separate flat file, `order-details.csv`,  defines the relationship linking `Orders` and `Products`.

However, it is quite common to have files where the relationship is defined by the same file as that used for the node at one (or sometimes both) ends of the relationship.
In this example, you can see how the `orders.csv` file also contains a `shipVia` column which could be used to define the relationship to a `Shipper` node created from the `shippers.csv` file.

To see how this mapping looks, here's an example for you to inspect the configuration.

button::Load Northwind shipper mapping[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint={northwind-subset-shipper-mapping-zip-file}]

Here you can see that the `orders.csv` file is used to define both the `Order` node and the `SHIPS` relationship, as well as mapping the `Shipper` node to `shippers.csv`.

=== Relationship defined in the same file as both nodes

In examples where the nodes at each end of the relationship are both mapped to the same file, the relationship can ususally be inferred by the same file.
If you first set up the nodes with their IDs and mapping, when then you draw the relationship, the `From` and `To` parts of the relationship will be mapped automatically.

You can try this out by loading the simple example below and connecting the two nodes that are mapped to the same file:

button::Load people and locations[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint={people_locations_nodes_only_zip_file}]

The model you are aiming for is as below.

image::import-people and locations.png[]

If you add the relationships and label their types as above, you'll observe that the `From` and `To` relationships are automatically mapped for you.

// TO-DO: Is not so neat in this example switching to a completely different context - would be better to add a Northwind related example of ths - look at doing this as it's a good example to show.

[%collapsible]
.Are you having trouble?
====
You can also click the button to load the people and locations with their relationship mapping.

button::Load configuration[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint={people_locations_full_zip_file}]
====

== Ready to import?

Let's get back to the Nortwind model, start by reloading the small Northwind model you created.

button::Load model and mapping[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint={northwind-subset-node-and-relationship-mapping-zip-file}]

Any object in your model without a green check mark means that the mapping is not complete.
If the mapping is not complete, you will not be able to run the import.

The following items **must be** mapped on a **node**:

* Label
* File
* A minimum of one property
* ID

The following items **must be** mapped on a **relationship**:

* Type
* File
* ID file columns (for both _From_ and _To_ nodes)

== Preview your graph

When you're satisfied with your model and mapping, you can preview a sample of your data before running the actual import.

Click the highlight:import/import-load-preview-button[Preview button] to see a sample of your data visualized.

image::preview.png[]

Even though the preview only scans the first few rows of your files, it is often sufficient to make sure everything connects as expected.
But you should keep in mind that it is only a preview and only a sample of your data.
The actual graph may look different once the full import is complete.

You want to have your mapping completely done before previewing, but if you have missed something, you are still able to do a preview, but the incomplete elements will not be rendered.
In other words, any element without a check mark in your model will not show up in the preview.

As mentioned before, if any element in your model not mapped, you will **not** be able to run the import.

== Running an import

Click highlight:import/import-run-import-button[Run import] to import the files specified in your model.

If any uploaded files are not specified in your model, these are **not** imported, but they remain in the highlight:import/import-file-panel[Files panel].

If any mapping is incomplete, you will be informed that your model has errors and a red exclamation mark is shown next to the incomplete element in the model.
When you select an incomplete element, the mapping pane also highlights the missing details.

Once you've addressed any errors, go ahead and run the import again.
You should see a popup window showing the successful results.

image::import_results.png[]

The summary shows what was included in the import.
You can compare to your CSV files to verify that everything was imported.

Congratulations on modelling, mapping, and loading your data!
You can now explore and query it to learn more about the power of graphs and Neo4j.
We have a few very useful importer tips to complete this guide.

[TIP]
====
Note that if you run this guide after the _Getting Started_ guide, the count may show _updated_ rather than _created_ since Data Importer will ensure duplicate IDs are not created for elements already loaded.
====

== Final tips

=== Saving and loading models

As you work with data models, may want to come back to it or share it at some point.
The importer lets you _download_ your model, with or without the data you've mapped to it.

Ensure you are in the import tab.

button::Import[role=NX_TAB_NAV,tab=import]

image::save_load.png[]

When you choose to download your model, with or without data, you are essentially saving it.
The model doesn't have to be mapped for you to download.

If you have a downloaded model, you can open it from this same menu, again with or without data.

The data is stored as CSV-files and the model as a JSON file, which makes it easy to share.

=== Re-running imports and updating your model

You can run the import multiple times without duplicating your data.
For example, if you want to make some changes to your model after you've run the import, just fix your model and when you are happy run the import again.
The changes you made will overwrite what you had before, but no existing elements will be recreated.

=== When you outgrow the Data Importer

Workspace's importer may not meet _all_ of your varied load needs, whether they are transformations or differing data formats.
If you need more control, the chances are you can achieve the load using some of the other approaches to loading data into Neo4j.
The following are useful resources for different needs:

- https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/load-csv/[LOAD CSV]] for writing your own bespoke Cypher load scripts from CSVs, leveraging the full capabilities of Cypher.
- https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/tutorial/neo4j-admin-import/[Neo4j-admin import]] for loading large amounts of CSV data rapidly into an offline database
- https://neo4j.com/product/connectors/[Neo4j connectors] to connect data from a variety of soruces into Neo4j.
- https://neo4j.com/docs/apoc/current/overview/apoc.load/[APOC Load procedures] for specialist Cypher procedures to make it easier to ingest data from formats including, json, xml and arrow.

== Frequently Asked Questions

*Missing files - why does Data Importer say I need to provide my files after I've aready provided them?*

When you provide the importer with your files, you are actually providing your web browser with a link to those files on your local file system, they aren't uploaded anywhere.
The importer streams the content of the files to you database only when you run the import.
If you reload the page, the importer loses access to the connection to those files due to security restrictions.
These are in place to prevent web applications accessing files you haven't given express permission to use on page load.
You simply need to re-provide the files when requested by data importer to be able to run an import.

*How can I replace a file?*

The importer doesn't currently allow you to swap out files in the UI.
However, there is a workaround that may prove useful.
If you want to provide a different file with the same column structure to data importer, you can rename it to match and then simply add the file to the files panel.
This will replace the reference to the latest file and be available for use by your import.


*How do I change the database Data Importer loads into?*

If you are using a Neo4j instance that supports multiple databases, the importer will use the home database to import data into.
You may have the facility to change the home database for the user that you connect to your DBMS with, read more on setting the home database for a user https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/access-control/manage-users/[here].
